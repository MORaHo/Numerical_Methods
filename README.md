# Numerical Methods

A collection of functions related to numerical methods, covering and extending from a numerical methods class I took at Polimi.
As an exercise I am trying to do everything without using numpy, but I do take a lot of inspiration from it, as well as Matlab/GNU Octave (which is what we used in the course).

The project by no means aims at optimization, if I wanted to do that I would be using LAPACK, like numpy, Matlab and GNU Octave do.
I am just trying to learn and have fun since this is a class I took particular interest in.

This is a work-in-progress personal project.
