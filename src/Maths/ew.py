## This is element wise multiplication for matrices, which is useful when using methods which require lambda functions which can take vectors but require only element wise multiplcation
## This is an equivalent to .* in matlab, and I have called ew for element-wise multiplication, and since the solution is ugly it makes it easier to remember the name
